    "\n",
    "The **Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP)** schedules dynamically arriving jobs on multiple machines to minimize total tardiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are $n$ successively arriving jobs $J=\\{J_1,\\dots,J_n\\}$ to be processed with $m$ machines $M=\\{M_1,\\dots,M_m\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each job $J_i$ has $n_i$ ordered operations $ O_{i,1},\\; O_{i,2},\\; \\dots,\\; O_{i,n_i}$.\n",
    "- Each operation $O_{i,j}$ can be processed on any compatible machine from its set $M_{i,j}\\subseteq M$, with processing time $t_{i,j,k}$ on machine $M_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each job has:\n",
    "    - Arrival time $A_i$\n",
    "    - Due date $D_i$\n",
    "    - Operation completion time $C_{i,j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- To simplify the problem there are some constraints on the system.\n",
    "    - **Capacity:** each machine processes at most one operation at a time.  \n",
    "    - **Precedence:** operations of the same job follow the fixed order $O_{i,1}\\!\\to\\! \\cdots \\!\\to\\! O_{i,n_i}$.  \n",
    "    - **Non-preemption:** once started, an operation runs to completion.  \n",

However, the problem of this approach is that in real world the number of jobs/machine/operations are large and can vary in a wide range, and taking these indicators as state decrease the generalizability of the RL agent. Since it can only perform well under the same same state size.\n",
